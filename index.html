            <p>The game's campaign is set in the European theatre and is centered around a squad in the 1st Infantry
                Division following their battles on the Western Front and set mainly in the historical events of
                Operation Overlord. The player controls Ronald "Red" Daniels, who has squadmates who can supply the
                player with extra ammunition, health, or grenades as well as a targeted grenade and target spotting;
                none of these are automatically replenished in the campaign. The multiplayer mode features map locations
                not seen in the campaign. The mode also features the new Divisions system, replacing the create-a-class
                system that previous games in the series used. A social hub, Headquarters, was also implemented into the
                game, allowing for players to interact with each other.</p>
